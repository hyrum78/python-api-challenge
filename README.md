# python-api-challenge
 
* This project is made up of 2 parts, WeatherPy and VacationPy.

 ## Part 1 - WeatherPy

This part uses a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. The data creates a representative model of weather across world cities using [simple Python library](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/citipy) and [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api).

## Part 2 - VacationPy

Part 2 of the project leverages the data from Part 1 to plan future vacations using jupyter-gmaps and the Google Places API.
